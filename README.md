# Deploy-ML-Projects-tutorial

Welcome to the Deploy-ML-Projects-tutorial repository! This project is designed to guide you through the process of transitioning from a research environment to a production environment for machine learning projects. The primary focus is on modularization, ensuring code testability, maintainability, and adherence to production standards. The Titanic dataset is utilized to demonstrate these concepts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this experiment, you will:

1. Understand the concept of modularization and convert the machine learning model developed in Jupyter Notebook into different modules tailored to specific functionalities: Data Manager, Training, Pipeline, Predict, etc.

2. Learn about testability and maintainability, dividing code into modules that are more extensible and easier to maintain and test.

3. Separate configuration from code where possible, and ensure that functionality is tested and documented.

4. Consider refactoring inefficient parts of the code base and ensure reproducibility.

5. Implement version control with clear processes for tracking releases and release versions, requirements, and dependencies.

6. Adhere to standards like PEP8 for code readability and collaboration.

7. Address scalability and performance concerns, preparing the production code for deployment to scalable infrastructure.
